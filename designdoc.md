_Try not to care what it looks like, AJ. Just make the game._


## Overview ##
You’re an entrepreneur. The player ‘rolls’ a character that represents the CEO or president of the company. You start or have a company that markets, manufactures and sells a product. The product design is not important to the player. The player’s time will be focused on hiring new people, managing costs for raw materials and labor, disciplining their workers if they slack off, and trying to make as much money as they can if they so choose. They can be as strict or as lenient as they want. The profits will scale depending on how good the player is at generating revenue and keeping their employees at being productive. The CEO will work til retirement

## Look and Feel ##
The CEO the player rolls and the employees they hire will have a cartoony and light hearted feel, yet the overall game will be challenging. Each employee will have a name and flavor text and something to make them relatable or noticeable. Even if the player is struggling with the game, hopefully they can be entertained by the workplace environment silliness or humor.

## Departments ##
Certain departments will do different things for the company. The player will have to balance the payroll and give

## Supply and Demand ##
These are the main variables in the game that will drive profits. The sales dept. will generate demand. The manufacturing dept. will generate supply. The engineering dept will increase the value of the product with design improvements. If there is supply and demand, then those products can go out and a sale can be made. If supply does not meet demand, customers will be less interested and the player will lose business. If demand does not meet supply, that is lost investment, since those materials and labor are going to waste. This is part of the management flow the player will have to balance.

## Company Location ##
The workers will occupy a building to do work in. The building will have size limitations and the player may choose to upgrade their capacity or go to a new building at a cost.

## Time system ##
Days will pass. The workers will go home. But you may ask them to stay later to finish something.
Deduct the money you owe your employees after pay days.

## Products ##
The company makes stuff. The player may have a tree of things it decides to manufacture. The manufacturing process will be shown in some way to the player. It’ll be shown in some fashion like when buildings are built in StarCraft ( just incrementtal stages of assembly being shown as it’s built) At the end of the day, if the product is not finished, it can’t be sold. These products will have names that are silly like they have no use.
“What does your company make?”
“We’re the industry leader in Zennyboppers. Our Zennyboppers are best in the world.” 

## Dictating Policy ##
Breaks: the player can give more or less breaks to their departments. This will affect the happiness of the employees and that will change the level of productivity.


## Employee antics ##
Employees will have varying amounts of work ethic. Some will be happy with less pay, but generally all of them (especially the ones that have good work ethic) will want incremental raises. Not all raise requests will be necessary for employee retention. The player will be balancing revenue growth with these increasing expenses.
There will be employee types upon hiring. Overhead will be more or less for each type. Like equipment they need or the pay scale they fall under.
Employees will slack off. The player will have a bird’s eye view or an overhead view of all the happenings of the company. Upon entering a room. The CEO may find people on their phones or sleeping. The player can interact with these instances and an entertaining scene will develop with the CEO waking up or snapping the workers focus back to working.
Employees want vacations. Employees that have important positions that go on vacation will cause a decrease in productivity when they’re gone.
They’ll want raises. This expected in the professional world and is good business. If the happiness variable goes down to low from being too hard on them or not giving them bonuses or paying them right. You could lose a good employee.
Certain employee to hate mondays and do bad work on them.
    Managers
    Some employees can be hired or promoted as managers. These will still produce work for their department but will also make rounds and make sure employees are being productive for the player. Managers naturally require more pay. 

## Hiring ##
When hiring, the player will be presented with a window showing available applicants. It will show simple information Like a name, character sprite, money wanted and some flavor text as it they were notes taken from an interview. The each candidate’s work ethic and productivity will vary.
Your reputation as CEO will affect the hiring process. If it’s bad, people will only want to work for you if you pay them a lot more. So this is incentive to the player to be a good boss. 
Some clues will be shown to the player on how good of an employee the possible candidates will be, but as with real-world hiring, you never really know how a worker will turn out. So it’s a gamble on picking one with a good work ethic.
### Robots ###
For an exorbitant amount, the player can buy an android or robot. The player can buy them outright or make payments. The benefit are that the robot does not get wages but will need expensive maintenance after a while. The robot will also work perfectly if maintained and will have a very high work ethic. On the funny side, the robot will still go to the water cooler to chat with workers and maybe a silly scene will unfold where a human and robot have an office romance. This will be profusely entertaining.

## Firing ##
I want this to be as satisfying as possible. Some employees will cry. Some will curse.

## Twitter integration ##
This possibly the most wild idea here. Flavor text and other information that is displayed in the game could be ‘crowdsourced’ from twitter. Using a either a hashtag related to the game or tweeting at a dedicated account, (e.g. #corpratecrusade of @corprateflavortext) a bot will then parse what users tweet for that and that will be injected into the game for other players to enjoy. For instance, someone tweets :    
@corprateflavortext Can’t stand you, but parents want him working and out of the basement more.   
This lame tweet can then be parsed by a bot ( if it get’s enough retweets) and then somehow added to a server that then adds that to the flavor text of an employee that can be hired. This will keep the game new all the time. Also it gamifies self-marketing.

## End game ##
### Time limit ###
The game has a time limit. The CEO will retire eventually.
### Losing ###
If you can’t or don’t pay employees, they’ll quit. Keeping up production will get harder as the company grows. If you manage your company badly, your reputation will go down and it might be so bad that you can’t hire any more.
