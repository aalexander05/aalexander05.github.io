I'm AJ. This is a site where I post about programming, game development, esports, things I'm learning, or random musings. Around the site, you'll see my badly organized documents and notes about my various projects that I've started likely soon abandoned.

This site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
